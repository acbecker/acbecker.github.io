Summary: About this blog

I'd like to use this blog as a vehicle to share my cognitive and
creative thoughts.  Putting myself out there, as it were.  Sometimes
out there will be "out there".  So be it.

There are three things that finally compelled me to put this all
together.  The first are remembered words of 
[Bill Walton](http://seattletimes.com/html/huskybasketball/2020352989_walton14.html),
along the lines of "walk like a giant, and get in the game of life".
This has always been a bit tricky for me, as I prefer to operate more
on the social fringes where I am less likely to be judged, to misstep,
or to let slip how strangely I prefer to interpret the world.  A bit
of social anxiety, as it were; perhaps more professional anxiety when
it truly comes down to it.  I am a faculty member, after all.  But I
am also myself.

The second is a great article by 
[Charles Mudede](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/seattle-has-stolen-the-microphone/Content?oid=18825201)
in the wake of the Seattle Seahawks' superbowl victory.  The last
couple paragraphs spoke to me, and speak to why I live in the Pacific
Northwest: the things happening in Seattle are "... all a bit
freakish, all a bit not with the American program, all a bit out
there."  This is the world I want to live in, and to be a part of.

Finally, the realization that in this 21st century, if you're not out
in it, you're at a disadvantage.  This is a time of massive
technological change, a grand opportunity, once in a lifetime, or even
rarer.  Not just for industry, art, and science but for communication,
the exchange of ideas, and the generation of new ones.  I have

absolutely lighting things up in new and different ways using these
new platforms.  Leading, being in the world, all in all nice work!
Inspiration accomplished.

Writing the code to make the future happen is not enough; you have to
represent it.  Which is what I intend to do here as best I can.
